# Geographical mapping of group members

In our last group lunch we realised that each one of our research group came from a different country, so we wondered who's closest and who's furthest from each other.  This repository contains the code that was developed as an example of collecting addresses (in this case our research group members) and plotting them on a map, while demonstrating the distances between members.

The code is written as an Rmarkdown file, producing a portable [HTML document](lab_members_geo.html) that can be readily shared by email or hosted on a [webpage](https://idobar.github.io/lab_members/).
